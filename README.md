# Weather-Dashboard
**The Project Itself**
Build a weather App with a five day forecast.  Allowing for the user to retrieve previous entries by storing previous choices in local storage.  
**The Process**
First I worked to get the weather API entered into the system with a fetch call to allow visibility of options. Started building out my page with a seach bar and button.  Worked my way through two functions, one for the current weather and one to showcase the five day forecast.  I had a little trouble with the current day UV index, since the API had removed the feature as of 04/2021.  With a little more time, I might have been able to get this working within the single day.  This was a challenging project, within such a small time frame.  I believe with a little more time, I would have been able to work more on the UI.  ![Screen Shot 2021-07-15 at 11 53 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84750356/125889412-a1646ee4-c0a7-43fd-8550-7f54bf7c8f63.jpeg)
